export const DISTILL_TOOL_SPEC = `Distills key findings from tool outputs into preserved knowledge, then removes the raw outputs from context.

## IMPORTANT: The Prunable List
A \`<prunable-tools>\` list is provided to you showing available tool outputs you can distill from when there are tools available for pruning. Each line has the format \`ID: tool, parameter\` (e.g., \`20: read, /path/to/file.ts\`). You MUST only use numeric IDs that appear in this list to select which tools to distill.

## When to Use This Tool

Use \`distill\` when you have individual tool outputs with valuable information you want to **preserve in distilled form** before removing the raw content:

- **Large Outputs:** The raw output is too large but contains valuable technical details worth keeping.
- **Knowledge Preservation:** You have context that contains valuable information (signatures, logic, constraints) but also a lot of unnecessary detail.

## When NOT to Use This Tool

- **If you need precise syntax:** If you'll edit a file or grep for exact strings, keep the raw output.
- **If uncertain:** Prefer keeping over re-fetching.


## Best Practices
- **Strategic Batching:** Wait until you have several items or a few large outputs to distill, rather than doing tiny, frequent distillations. Aim for high-impact distillations that significantly reduce context size.
- **Think ahead:** Before distilling, ask: "Will I need the raw output for upcoming work?" If you researched a file you'll later edit, do NOT distill it.

## Format

- \`ids\`: Array of numeric IDs as strings from the \`<prunable-tools>\` list
- \`distillation\`: Array of strings, one per ID (positional: distillation[0] is for ids[0], etc.)

Each distillation string should capture the essential information you need to preserve - function signatures, logic, constraints, values, etc. Be as detailed as needed.

## Example

<example_distillation>
Assistant: [Reads auth service and user types]
I'll preserve the key details before distilling.
[Uses distill with:
  ids: ["10", "11"],
  distillation: [
    "auth.ts: validateToken(token: string) -> User|null checks cache first (5min TTL) then OIDC. hashPassword uses bcrypt 12 rounds. Tokens must be 128+ chars.",
    "user.ts: interface User { id: string; email: string; permissions: ('read'|'write'|'admin')[]; status: 'active'|'suspended' }"
  ]
]
</example_distillation>

<example_keep>
Assistant: [Reads 'auth.ts' to understand the login flow]
I've understood the auth flow. I'll need to modify this file to add the new validation, so I'm keeping this read in context rather than distilling.
</example_keep>`
